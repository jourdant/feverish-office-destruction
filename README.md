##Concept
You are an emergency services operator. Georg(e|ina) calls in desperation as his/her building is on fire!!!

Your mission is to help Georg(e|ina) escape almost certain death. Guide Georg(e|ina) from the top left corner, to the stairs in the bottom right corner of the building. All you have is a copy of the blueprints. You will need to rely on the voice feedback from Georg(e|ina) to figure out the best path.


**Good luck.**
